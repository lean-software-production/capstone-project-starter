## Codespaces and Dev Containers

This repository includes a Dev Container for GitHub Codespaces and local Dev
Container users. It provides Node.js plus Pi, Claude Code, and Codex (installed
from the [lean-software-production devcontainer features](https://github.com/lean-software-production/devcontainer-features)).
Open the repository in a container, then authenticate the agent you want to use
as the non-root `node` user—credentials are not included in the image or
repository. The Dev Container also installs the optional Codex VS Code extension
in the remote extension host; the `codex` terminal workflow remains fully
supported.

```sh
# Pick one. Codespaces users can use the device-code flow when browser callback
# login is inconvenient.
pi                 # then enter /login
claude auth login
codex login --device-auth

# Confirm the environment without contacting a model.
bin/doctor
bin/doctor --agent codex
```

`bin/doctor` checks Node.js, Git, Bash, and all three agent CLIs. By default it
requires the tools and at least one configured agent; `--agent pi`,
`--agent claude`, or `--agent codex` checks a specific choice, and
`--agent all` requires every agent to be configured. It does not read credential
contents or make a model request. For Pi, it uses `pi auth check --no-refresh`
against a saved/uniquely identifiable provider; ambiguous Pi configuration is
reported as unknown rather than ready. Once it reports ready, start Pi with `pi`,
Claude Code with `claude`, or Codex with `codex`.

Run `tests/doctor_test.sh` to exercise `bin/doctor` against fake agent CLIs.
